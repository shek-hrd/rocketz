would you write a script for me, that I could embed in any page later, that works like a simple game?

-lets start with a text frame, but later we can use any rectrangular area on the page for the playfield
-I need a test page, with a frame that is a simple text editor -- one can type into the window
-I want the text frame initially empty and focused -- so that one may start to type immediately upon page load
-as one clicks into the frame, the arrow that is controllable by keyboard arrows appears
-the arrow should appear at the spot, where one clicks within the frame, pointing up
-the arrow needs to be independent from the text, so that it can move freely, while being controlled by keyboard arrows, so that one could be piloting it around the frame
-up arrow  speeds it up -- it should wrap around the frame, so that when it leaves the frame up, it reappears from the bottom
-down arrow  slows it down to a full stop
-right arrow  turns it right, left arrow  turns it left
-keyboard arrows should stop controlling the text windows cursor, or the page, when the rocket is present
-the rocket needs to stay within the text frame and reappear on the same x coordinate when leaving up or down, and the same y coordinate when leaving the frame left and right
-I want the rocket to be independent of the page dimensions, or the position of the text frame on the page. I want it to be dependent only on the position within the text frame

-within the text frame, on the background, bottom right, light gray, show the dimension of the text frame, coordinates of the mouse cursor, coordinates of the rocket, rockets speed, and the rockets orientation

-the rocket needs to avoid the typed text, on crash disappear and switch to the usual text frame editor mode

when this works, I'll give you more instructions
